			Take Aim, PointBlanc’s pre Aether event, was hosted on
			Monday, 23<sup>rd</sup> September 2019. Take Aim was an intra
			college eSports event aimed at propelling gaming
			culture, competitiveness and introducing people
			unfamiliar with the gaming world to witness this.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The preparations would start right as the idea was
			conceived. One week of discussions, one night to make it
			all stand. We got tables and benches for a premier
			eSports feel, decorated the place with LED Lights and
			strips to create an aura of RGB and of course had our
			very own custom built PC act as the main
			spectator/operator PC
			<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BveuJwBnt1v/"
			target="_blank" style="color: white;" class="glowify-text">
				(called Winry)
			</a>.
			<br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The day began in a flurry of arrangements and logistical
			work. Once everything was set, we were ready to kick
			off. We had a packed up room with about 150 students
			sitting eagerly. Some were here to cheer their friends, some
			were here to try out games and of course some were here to compete
			for glory.
			<span class="color-text-flow" style="font-size: 1.5em;">Begin</span>.
			<br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			We started the gaming event with the
			comeback-of-the-year game. Minecraft. For Minecraft our
			goal was simple, let’s showcase the Ender Dragon being
			beat to a pulp by our elite group of students who had
			their enchantments and gear ready for the night. 15 of
			them went into the dark realm of the End. 7 of them
			perished, the rest reclaimed victorious and came out
			with the egg defining themselves as the rulers of the
			seed. After the End Battle, to spice up the competition,
			we had our contestants on the stage battle it out in
			Minecraft Hunger Games. 17 participants playing it live,
			slowly and slowly one after the other they kept dying to
			each other until the last one surviving was Theabominog
			declaring himself as #1!
			<br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			As the Minecraft matches were going on and being
			broadcasted and commentated on the projectors, we had a
			PUBG tournament going on at the back of the room as
			well. After an intense 28 minutes of Battle, Team Damn
			(Damn Dez, Damn Angry, Damn Gomel and CIA MrAli) came
			out securing themselves a chicken dinner and a massive
			round of applause.
			<br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			After Minecraft, we had our showboat event, the Paladins
			invitational. But before we get into that, let’s talk a
			little bit about the scenario at hand. Minecraft and PUBG
			just got over and Paladins had a few connections issues
			to sort out, so what do we do in the downtime to keep
			people engaged. We had laptops set up with nostalgic
			games like Tekken, Cuphead, NFS and VR experiences like
			SuperHot VR and Beat Saber for people to try out and
			enjoy.
			<br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Once Paladins was set up, the game was on. We invited
			the biggest Paladins rivalry in our college to partake
			at this stage. Team KK vs Team BSB. This rivalry had
			been going on for two years now and the pregame trash
			talk was fresh. Game 1 began with a flurry of cheers and
			excitement from the crowd. Each team had their supporters
			cheering for them when a play happened. The game was a
			flurry of emotions and suffice to say that Paladins is
			one of the most fun eSports games to watch. Everyone in
			the room was hooked, whether they knew what they were
			looking at or not.
			<br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Game 1 turned out to be a spectacular roller coaster of
			emotions. With both teams at 1 point each, Team BSB
			decided that they had enough playing small and went all
			on board the payload for the next rounds managing a 1-3
			lead and requiring just another capture to win. However,
			the beaten in morale Team KK had a mental ace up their
			sleeves, they knew they had to step up for their glory
			and put up a fight of equal consequence on a stage like
			this. They did just that by winning the next two rounds
			and tying the score at 3-3. With the last round left and
			winning momentum favoring Team KK, they were able to
			successfully suppress Team BSB and take Game 1 for
			themselves.
			<br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Game 2 was an evenly spaced match between these two
			competitive teams, the snipes from BSB were spot on but
			so were the heals from KK nullifying them. Every attack
			was checked by a defending opponent and every role was
			filled in. You could literally pick anyone to spectate
			and you would just be in awe at their skill and quick
			decision making. The fans were on the side of BSB,
			cheering them on. BSB made tons of important picks
			during the game, wreaking havoc to KK who were ever so
			effectively trying to hold back their attacks or push
			their defenses. A decisive Game indeed that had to go to
			BSB leading to a game 3 to break the tie.
			<br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			This is where it would end. The next 15-20 minutes would
			decide who’d walk away as the winners. Sweat dripped
			from the players, and discussions about tactics and pick
			select were hot. Their serious faces were on and there
			was no time to joke about. Well, at least that’s what
			both the teams were thinking but I guess one of these
			teams took it way to seriously. I mean, they were
			unstoppable. The game went in early favor of BSB scoring
			the first point. However KK had just kept quietly
			staring down the arena with their beast locked up. Now
			they felt like releasing it, and ever since, round after
			round KK kept winning and the positive momentum from
			them and the fans kept pulling them ahead securing their
			victory decisively and crowning themselves as <b>the</b>
			Paladins team of the college.
			Team KK were comprised of (yourdeathgod, sandeepsayi, virtualsailor, kk (Captain), vsvsharma)
			<br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			At the same time, CSGO and FIFA qualifiers were going
			on. The CSGO semis were being played to decide the
			second finalists. Team Yes ended up winning the semis
			in a close decisive 14-16. Team Yes would thus face off
			against the invincible Team pi in a best of finals.
			<br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			As the CSGO game was being set up, the FIFA finalists
			were decided. Rohan Joseph beat the defending champion,
			Yashwant Thota in a close 2-1 game and secured his spot
			in the finals meanwhile Om Goyal beat Jansen Khan to
			count himself as the challenger. The game was intense,
			with Om picking up and early lead right before the half
			time only to be put in his place by Rohan equalizing
			soon after the half time whistle. After that, it was all
			Rohan, skill moves, tricks, possession. He forced Om to
			retreat and play defensively meanwhile making it a
			nuisance for himself cause Om hadn’t gotten this far
			just by his attack tactics, his defense was spot on.
			However, Rohan lead Om into an attacking trap and used
			the opportunity to create a counter which turned out to
			be a skill shot goal, during the goalie and chipping it
			over to end up in the box and taking the lead. The video
			below is the reactions of that. We really wish we could
			have got the play :(
			<br><br>

			<br>

		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The crowd couldn’t keep to their seats and everyone roared at the
			spectacle ahead. To solidify his lead, Rohan scored
			another and just like that won the entire tournament
			becoming the best FIFA player in the college.
			<br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			CSGO was the last of our games, the invincible Team pi
			defeated Team yes in a awestruck battle. 16-4 the
			scoreline lay as Beast and NeXT from Team pi held on to
			their AWPs and never let an opponent target out of
			sight. With quick comms and insightful positioning,
			their communication would show from their plays and one
			after another they kept winning to stand invincible and
			strong as the undefeated CSGO team of the college.
			Team pi consists of (NeXT, Beast, KaiserPanic, Ashura, YSA001)
			<br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			All in all, this event was as close as it got to having
			a large scale intercollege eSports event in our college
			and taught us a lot about managing, handling crowds,
			delivering impromptu, and dealing with technical and
			managerial issues. The feedback was amazing with
			students wanting more to happen in the same semester.
			Some wanting even every week.
			<span class="color-text-flow">
				This is what excites us to bring this to Aether
				this year for the entire city.
